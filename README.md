   ![alt-text](https://github.com/soopertramp/url-shortner/blob/main/flask.png)

This is a lightweight URL shortener built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. The application allows users to generate short aliases for long URLs, making it easy to share links in a concise and user-friendly manner.

## Features:

      URL Shortening: Quickly create short aliases for long URLs.
      Redirection: Users are redirected to the original URL when they access the shortened link.
      Customizable Aliases: Choose custom aliases for your shortened URLs.
